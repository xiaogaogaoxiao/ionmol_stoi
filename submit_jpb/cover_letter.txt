Dear Editor

I am sending you our manuscript entitled "Ionization of biological 
molecules by multicharged ions using the stoichiometric model" by 
Mendez et al. to be considered for publication in the Journal of Physics B.

In our work, we investigate the ionization of several molecules of biological 
interest by the impact of multicharged ions in the intermediate to 
high energy range. The molecular ionization total cross sections were 
obtained with full non-perturbative distorted-wave atomic (CDW) calculations 
of thirty-six ion-target systems and a simple stoichiometric model (SSM). 
Our results for ionization of seventeen complex molecules by impact of
proton, antiproton, H^2+, Be^4+, C^6+ and O^8+, gives good agreement 
with available experimental data. 

We also study the widely known Toburen scaling of the total ionization
cross section with the number of weakly bound electrons, and we propose 
a new set of active electron numbers based on the atomic CDW results. 
The results of the extensive ion-target examination included in the 
present study allow us to assert that the SSM and the CDW-based scaling 
will be useful tools in this area.

We confirm that this manuscript has not been published elsewhere and its
not under consideration by another journal. All authors have approved 
the manuscript and agree with its submission to the Journal of Physics B

Please let me know of your consideration at your earliest convenience.

Best regards,
Alejandra Mendez
